# 🧰 Retro Typewriter Cyberdeck (Raspberry Pi 5 DIY Build)

I built this cyberdeck as a broke international student studying in London.  
It was cold, I was sick all the time, and instead of going outside like a normal human, I stayed in my dorm and made *this*.

It's inspired by vintage typewriters, powered by a Raspberry Pi 5, and held together by… **cardboard, foam, AliExpress parts, and pure desperation**.

## 🧠 Why I Built It

- UK winter said: “Go outside and you die.”  
- Long-distance relationship said: “Stay online.”  
- My brain said: “We ball. Build a cyberdeck.”  

I wanted something:
✅ Mechanical keyboard  
✅ Portable writing machine  
✅ Retro vibes  
✅ But not *just* a word processor — it had to run other stuff too

## ⚙️ Features & Limitations

### ✅ Works great for:
- Writing, journaling, note-taking
- Distraction-free typing (typewriter energy)
- Looking mysterious in coffee shops
- Pretending you're a Victorian-era hacker

### ❌ Known “Features” (a.k.a problems)
- To close the lid, you must unplug half the cables like you're disarming a bomb
- Ergonomics? Never heard of her
- UPS battery % doesn’t show properly in Ubuntu (still unsolved, send help)
- Cardboard + foam interior is surprisingly effective but emotionally fragile

## 🧪 Operating System & Setup

- OS: Ubuntu on Raspberry Pi 5  
- Mainly used for writing & research  
- Might eventually evolve into something cyberpunk & unhinged  

---

## 🏁 Status

- Built during my MSc in the UK  
- Currently back in Vietnam and busy with life  
- Might upgrade or build another one in the future

## 🙏 Disclaimer

This project contains no “real code”, no CAD files, no engineering logic, and probably violates several design principles — but it **brings me joy**, and that’s what matters.
